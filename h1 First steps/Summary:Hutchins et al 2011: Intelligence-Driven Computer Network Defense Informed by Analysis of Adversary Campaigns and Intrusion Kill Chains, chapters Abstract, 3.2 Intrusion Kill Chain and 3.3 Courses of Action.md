### The article made me understand the concept of the intrusion kill chain as a way to understand how cyber attackers work and how to defend against them. Imagine it as a step-by-step process they follow to breach a system. It introduces a special plan for computer attacks. Attackers need to get past security barriers, enter a safe area, and then do harmful things. This plan has stages: finding targets, making dangerous tools, delivering these tools, exploiting weaknesses, setting up secret controls, commanding actions, and finally, doing harmful things.

### There are different Stages which are like different parts of the attack plan:

## 1. Reconnaissance: 
Attackers look for targets, often by checking websites and emails to find weak points.

## 2. Weaponization:
They create harmful tools that can break into computers. These tools can be hidden in regular files.

## 3. Delivery: 
The harmful tools are sent to the target, often through emails, websites, or USB drives.

## 4. Exploitation: 
They use these tools to find and use weak spots in the computer.

## 5. Installation: 
Once inside, they secretly set up ways to control the computer from afar.

## 6. Command and Control: 
Attackers send commands to control the attacked computer remotely.

## 7. Actions on Objectives:
After doing all this, they can finally do the harmful things they planned. This could be stealing information or causing damage.

### In the intrusion kill chain, defenders match their security measures to the attacker's steps. This helps them see how well their actions work and where they need to improve. This approach is like learning from the attacker's moves and making smart decisions to protect systems better.

### To stop attackers, we need to defend at each stage:

## Detect: 
Notice when something bad is happening.

## Deny: 
Block attackers from getting in.

## Disrupt: 
Make it hard for them to do their plan.

## Degrade: 
If they get in, limit what they can do.

## Deceive: 
Trick them into doing things that don't help them.

## Destroy: 
Remove their tools.

#### This breakdown of the intrusion kill chain is a fantastic way to simplify a complex topic like cybersecurity. Understanding how attackers work and the stages they follow helps us develop smarter defense strategies. What steps do you think are the most critical for defenders to focus on?
