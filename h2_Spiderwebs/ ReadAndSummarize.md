# A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration

Security misconfiguration is a common vulnerability that can be prevented by implementing secure installation processes.
Misconfigurations are common in applications, with 90% of tested apps having some form of misconfiguration.
Misconfigurations can lead to a variety of attacks, including data breaches, account takeovers, and denial-of-service attacks.

To prevent misconfigurations, organizations should implement secure installation processes, such as:

Using a repeatable hardening process to ensure that applications are configured securely each time they are deployed.  

Deploying minimal platforms that only include the necessary components and features.  

Regularly reviewing and updating configurations to address new vulnerabilities and patches.  

Segmenting application architecture to isolate different components and tenants.  
Sending security directives to clients to help protect sensitive data.  
Automating the verification of configurations to ensure that they are always up-to-date and secure.   


# A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Vulnerable and outdated components are a major security risk, as they can be exploited by attackers to gain access to systems and data. Organizations should implement a patch management process to prevent them.

Organizations should implement a patch management process to identify and fix vulnerabilities in components as soon as possible.
This process should include:

Removing unused dependencies, features, files, and documentation.
Continuously inventorying versions using tools like OWASP Dependency Check, retire.js, etc.
Monitoring CVE and NVD for vulnerabilities in components.
Obtaining components only from official, secure sources.
Monitoring for unmaintained components, and considering virtual patches.
Ensuring ongoing monitoring, triaging, and updates throughout the application's lifetime.


# A03:2021-Injection
Injection is a common vulnerability that can allow attackers to inject malicious code into an application, resulting in a variety of attacks, such as data theft, denial-of-service attacks, and remote code execution.

To prevent injection attacks, organizations should properly validate and sanitize all user input. This includes using parameterized queries, escaping special characters, and limiting the amount of data that is returned from queries.
Organizations should also use static, dynamic, and interactive security testing tools to identify and fix injection vulnerabilities.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection attacks:

Use a safe API or ORM framework to help prevent injection attacks.
Implement input validation at the application layer.
Use regular expressions to escape special characters in user input.
Limit the amount of data that is returned from queries.
Use security testing tools to identify and fix injection vulnerabilities.
